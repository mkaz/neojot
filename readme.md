# NeoJot

A plugin for Neovim to help jotting notes.

The goal is to maintain some simiarity with Vimwiki, but not be
backwards compatible or even map to every feature.

## Roadmap

- **v0.1**
    - [x] Main Index Page
    - [x] Configure wiki location
    - [x] Create New Daily Note
    - [x] Configurable Filenames and Paths
    - [ ] Navigate forward/backward notes

TODO:

- Create proper functions that allows custom keybindings
- Probably don't want to do everything in one file
